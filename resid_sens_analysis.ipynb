    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a basic introduction to two traditional data analysis and model diagnostic techniques that can be applied to machine learning models: residual analysis and sensitivity analysis. The notebook starts by loading the UCI credit card default dataset and using h2o to train a GBM model to predict credit card defaults. Then, residual analysis is used to discover and debug an issue with the GBM, and the GBM is retrained and improved. The notebook concludes by conducting sensitivity analysis to test the GBM credit card default model for fairness and stability. "

    "Sensitivity analysis investigates whether model behavior and outputs remain stable when data is intentionally perturbed or other changes are simulated in data. Beyond traditional assessment practices, sensitivity analysis of machine learning model predictions is perhaps the most important validation technique for machine learning models. Machine learning models can make drastically differing predictions for only minor changes in input variable values. In practice, many linear model validation techniques focus on the numerical instability of regression parameters due to correlation between input variables or between input variables and the dependent variable. It may be prudent for those switching from linear modeling techniques to machine learning techniques to focus less on numerical instability of model parameters and to focus more on the potential instability of model predictions.\n",

If the contribution of potentially sensitive variables, such as those related to gender, race, age, marital status, or disability status, can be shown to have minimal impact on the model, this is an indication of fairness in the model predictions and can also increase overall trust in the model."
