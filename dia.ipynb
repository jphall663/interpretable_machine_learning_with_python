    "# Increase Fairness in Your Machine Learning Project with Disparate Impact Analysis using Python and H2O\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assess if your machine learning model is treating different groups of people similarly or differently\n",
    "\n",
    "Fairness is an incredibly important, but highly complex entity. So much so that leading scholars have yet to agree on a strict definition. However, there is a practical way to discuss and handle *observational* fairness, or how your model predictions affect different groups of people. This procedure is often known as disparate impact analysis (DIA). DIA is far from perfect, as it relies heavily on user-defined thresholds and reference levels for disparity and does not attempt to remediate disparity or provide information on sources of disparity, but it is a fairly straightforward method to quantify your model’s behavior across sensitive demographic segments or other potentially interesting groups of observations. DIA is also an accepted, regulation-compliant tool for fair-lending purposes in the U.S. financial services industry. If it’s good enough for multibillion-dollar credit portfolios, it’s probably good enough for your project. \n",
    "\n",
    "This example DIA notebook starts by training a constrained, monotonic gradient boosting machine (GBM) classifier on the UCI credit card default data using the popular open source library, h2o. A probability cutoff for making credit decisions is selected by maximizing the F1 statistic and confusion matrices are generated to summarize the GBM’s decisions across male and female customers. A basic DIA procedure is then conducted using the information stored in the confusion matrices to calculate an adverse impact ratio. Several other disparity and parity metrics are calculated, and although it's abusing the technique, those will also be discussed and analyzed in the context of DIA.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because DIA really only considers groups of people, it's important to pair DIA with constrained models that can't treat similar people too differently. When using complex models with DIA, it's also important to look for any local, or individual, dicrimination that would not be flagged in the group quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an excellent and free reference on the topics of fairness and machine learning be sure to follow the book being written by Solon Barocas, Moritz Hardt and Arvind Narayanan: https://fairmlbook.org/. \n",

(Constrained models may also generalize better in low signal-to-noise scenarios.)

    "#### Train h2o GBM classifier with monotonicity constraints\n",
    "Many tuning parameters must be specified to train a GBM using h2o. Typically a grid search would be performed to identify the best parameters for a given modeling task using the `H2OGridSearch` class. For brevity's sake, a previously-discovered set of good tuning parameters are specified here. Because gradient boosting methods typically resample training data, an additional random seed is also specified for the h2o GBM using the `seed` parameter to create reproducible predictions, error rates, and variable importance values. To avoid overfitting, the `stopping_rounds` parameter is used to stop the training process after the test error fails to decrease for 5 iterations. Monotonicity constraints are passed to the GBM using the `monotone_constraints` parameter."

    "#### Function to calculate PR-AUC Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive models often produce probabilities, not decisions. So to make a decision with a model-generated predicted probability for any one customer, you must specify a numeric cutoff above which we say a customer will default and below which we say they will not default. Cutoffs play a crucial role in DIA as they impact the underlying measurements used to calculate diparity. In fact, tuning cutoffs carefully is a potential remdiation tactic for any discovered disparity. There are many accepted ways to select a cutoff (besides simply using 0.5) and in this notebook the cutoff will be selected by striking a balance between the model's recall (true positive rate) and it's precision using the F1 statistic. Using precision and recall to select a cutoff is sometimes seen as more robust to imbalanced data than the standard ROC approach. Maximizing F1 typically results in a good balance between sensitivity and precision. \n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting a cutoff can be done intervactively with h2o Flow as well. Enter the url: http://localhost:54321/flow/index.html (or your H2O Connection URL displayed in cell 2) into your browser. Select `Models` -> `List all models` -> `dia_gbm` and you should see an interactive ROC curve where you can pick your own cutoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about confusion matrices see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** h2o supports `pr_auc` directly: http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-py/docs/metrics.html#h2o.model.metrics_base.MetricsBase.pr_auc. This utility function is used here to give more control over the plotting of the PR curve below."

    "The general confusion matrix shows that the GBM is more accurate than not because the true positive and true negative cells contain the largest values by far. But the GBM seems to make a larger number of type II errors or false negative predictions. False negatives can be a disparity issue, because for complex reasons, many credit scoring and other models tend to over-estimate the likelihood of non-reference groups - typically people other than white males - to default. This is both a sociological fairness problem and a financial problem if an unpriviledged group is not recieving the credit they deserve, in favor of undeserving white males. Deserving people miss out on potentially life-changing credit and lenders incur large write-off costs."

False omissions measures how many customers the model predicted *incorrectly* would not default, out of the customers in the group the model *predicted* would not default. (Of course other metrics are important from a fairness and business perspective. For an excellent in-depth discussion and example regarding numerous disparity metrics, see: https://github.com/dssg/aequitas/blob/master/docs/source/examples/compas_demo.ipynb)"

    "#### Calculate and report disparity\n",
    "To calculate disparity we compare the confusion matrix for each sex to the metrics for a user-defined reference level and to user-defined thresholds. In this case, we take the class of people who seem most priviledged as the reference level, i.e. `SEX = male`. (Usually the reference level would be `race = white` or `sex = male`.) According to the four-fifths rule (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disparate_impact#The_80%_rule) thresholds are set such that metrics 20% lower or higher than the reference level metric will be flagged as disparate. **Technically, the four-fifths rule only applies to the adverse impact ratio, or \"adverse impact disparity\" below, but it will be applied to all other displayed metric as a rule of thumb.**"

    "Importantly, the GBM appears to have adverse impact parity, and many other types of positive parity characteristics. However, the model is still suffering from a minor disparity problem due to it's propensity to make false negative predictions for males. To address such bias users could tune the GBM cutoff or regularization, could try new methods for reweighing data prior to model training, try new modeling methods specifically designed for fairness, or post-process the decisions. Checkout the IBM AIF360 package for some of these techniques: http://aif360.mybluemix.net/. Before attempting remediation here, local, or individual, fairness will also be investigated. "

    "About 77% of men are awarded a loan by the model. About 79.6% of women are awarded a loan. This results in a marginal effect of -2.60%. Given that the marginal effect is negative, indicating that a higher percentage of individuals in the protected group were awarded a loan than in the reference group, this value would likely not indicate a discrimination problem in most scenarios. The magnitude of the marginal effect is also relatively small, another sign that discrimination concerning SEX is low under the model. Generally, larger marginal effects may be tolerated in newer credit products, whereas smaller marginal effects are expected in established credit products."

    "In nonlinear models, similar people can be treated differenly by the model, so even if the model is mostly fair for most kinds of people, there could still be people the model treated unfairly. This could occur for multiple reasons, including the functional form of the learned model or because different variables are combined by the model to represent strong signals. If a variable is important in a dataset, model, or problem domain it's likely that a nonlinear model will find combinations of other variables to act as proxies for the problematic variable -- potentially even different combinations for different rows of data!

In a complex, real-world machine learning project the hard-to-define phenomenas of sociological bias and unfairness can materialize in many ways and from many different sources. Although far from a flawless technique, the beauty of DIA is it is straightforward to implement, functions in a model-agnostic fashion on known labels and model predictions, and is applied in complex real-world fair lending situations, so it can probably be applied to your model too! \n",
