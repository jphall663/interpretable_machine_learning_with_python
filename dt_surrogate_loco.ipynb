    "Decision trees and decision tree ensembles are some of the most popular machine learning models used in commercial practice. They can train and make predictions on data containing character values and missing values - both common in large commercial data stores. Single decision trees are easily represented as directed graphs, which can drastically increase their interpretability and transparency. Decision tree ensembles (i.e., random forests and gradient boosting machines (GBMs)), can be used to increase the accuracy and stability of single decision tree models, but are far less intepretable than single trees. These characteristics of decision trees will be leveraged here to increase transparency and accountability in complex, nonlinear, machine learning models.\n",

    "This notebook starts by training a GBM on the UCI credit card default data using the popular open source library, h2o. A single decision tree *surrogate* model will then be trained on the original UCI credit card default data and the predictions from the h2o GBM, to create an approximate flow chart for the GBM's global decision-making processes. A technique known as leave-one-covariate-out (LOCO) will then be used to generate local explanations for any row-wise prediction made by the GBM model. Finally, local explanations are ensembled together from multiple similar models to increase explanation stability. "

One of the original references for surrogate models is available here: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1152-extracting-tree-structured-representations-of-trained-networks.pdf. In this example, a single decision tree will be trained on the original inputs and predictions of the h2o GBM model and the tree will be visualized using special functionality in h2o and GraphViz. The variable importance, interactions, and decision paths displayed in the directed graph of the trained decision tree surrogate model are then assumed to be indicative of the internal mechanisms of the more complex GBM model, creating an approximate, overall flowchart for the GBM. There are few mathematical guarantees that the simple surrogate model is highly representative of the more complex GBM, but a recent preprint article has put forward ideas on strenghthening the theoretical relationship between surrogate models and more complex models: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08504.pdf. Since surrogate models alone do not gaurantee accurate transparency, they will be used along with GBM variable importance and LOCO to build a cohesive narrative about the mechansims within the GBM. **Because most currently-available explanatory techniques are approximate, it is recommended that users employ several different explanatory techniques and trust only consisent results across techniques.**"

Setting the `mtry` parameter to `-2` tells the `H2ORandomForestEstimator` to consider all variables in all splits of a tree, instead of considering a random subset of columns. It is also recommended to set a random seed for reproducibility and to set `max_depth` to a lower number, say less than 6, so that the surrogate model will not become overly complex and hard to explain and understand. Once the tree is trained, a model optimized java object (MOJO) representation of the tree is saved. H2o provides a way to visualize the trained tree in detail using the MOJO and Graphviz."

    "## 4. Analyze surrogate model and compare to global GBM variable importance\n",
    "\n",
    "The displayed tree is comparable with the global GBM variable importance. A simple heuristic rule for variable importance in a decision tree relates to the depth and frequency at which a variable is split on in a tree: variables used higher in the tree and more frequently in the tree are more important. Most of the variables pictured in this tree also appear as highly important in the GBM variable importance plot. In both cases, `PAY_0` is appearing as crucially important, with other payment behavior variables following close behind. The surrogate decision tree enables users to understand and confirm not only what input variables are important, but also how their values contribute to model decisions. For instance, to fall into the lowest probability of default leaf node in the surrogate decision tree a customer must make their first and second payments in a timely fashion and then pay more than 1515.5 New Tiawanese Dollars for their fifth payment. Conversely, customers who miss their first, fifth, and third payments fall into the highest probability of default leaf node of the surrogate decision tree. It is also imperative to compare these results to domain knowledge and reasonable expectations. In this case, the global explanatory methods applied thus far tell a consisent and reasonable story about the GBM's behavior. If this was not so, steps should be taken to either reconcile or remove inconsistencies and unreasonable prediction behavior."

    "\n",
    "Now that a solid understanding of global model behavior has been attained, local behavior for any given row of data and prediction can be analyzed and validated using LOCO. The LOCO method presented here is adapted from *Distribution-Free Predictive Inference for Regression* by Jing Lei et al., http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/papers/conformal.pdf. Here the local contribution of an input variable to a prediction for a single row of data is estimated by rescoring the GBM on that row one time for each input variable, each time leaving out one input variable (e.g., \"covariate\") by setting it to missing, and then subtracting the new score from the original score. By default, h2o scores missing data in decision trees by running them through the majority decision path. This means LOCO will be a numeric measure of how different the local contribution of an input variable is from the most common local contribution of that variable in the model. This variant of LOCO differs from the original method, in which one input variable is dropped from the model and the model is retrained without that variable. For nonlinear models, nonlinear dependencies can allow variables to nearly completely replace one another when a variable is dropped and the model is retrained. Hence, the approach of injecting missing values is used to estimate local contributions of input variables for nonlinear models here, as opposed to dropping a variable and retraining the model."

    "In this notebook, a complex GBM classifier was trained to predict credit card defaults and explained at a global scale with a decision tree surrogate model and explained at a local scale with LOCO. An ensemble LOCO approach was also introduced to stabilize approximate explanations. The decision tree surrogate creates an overall approximate flowchart for the GBM's decision processes and LOCO can be used to create reason codes for each model prediction. All of these techniques enhance the transparency of the complex model, which in turn enables greater accountability for the model's predictions. These techniques should generalize well for many types of business and research problems, enabling you to train a complex GBM model and explain it to your colleagues, bosses, and potentially, external regulators.
